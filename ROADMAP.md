# Stellaris Astrocartography — App Roadmap

## 🔗 Bonds Feature (Relationship Astrocartography)

A new relationship-focused mode that overlays two users' astrocartographic charts on the same map. Requires the Friends system (already built) as a prerequisite.

### Dual-Toggle Interface

Two analysis modes accessible via a toggle at the top of the Bonds map view:

| Toggle | Label | Astrology Term | Purpose |
|--------|-------|----------------|---------|
| **1** | Individual Harmony | Synastry | How each person *individually* feels in a location — short-term comfort, day-to-day energy |
| **2** | Relationship Destiny | Composite | The *merged* energy of the relationship in a location — long-term shared purpose |

---

### 🌀 Synastry View (Individual Harmony)

Overlays **both** users' full line sets on the same map.

**Visual Design:**
- Lines should be rendered **very light and transparent** (high opacity, low stroke weight) to avoid visual clutter — two full charts will have up to 80 lines on screen
- The focus should be on **areas of overlap**, both positive and negative
- Where lines from both charts converge in the same region, highlight those zones (glow, pulse, or fill)
- Use each user's profile color or two distinct tint families so the viewer can tell whose line is whose

**Key Callouts:**
- **Positive overlaps** — regions where both partners have beneficial lines (Jupiter, Venus, Sun) concentrated together; surface these prominently
- **Difficult individual lines** — flag if one partner has a challenging line (Pluto, Saturn) running through an area even when the other partner has positive energy there

---

### 🪐 Composite View (Relationship Destiny)

Calculates a **single composite chart** from the midpoints of both partners' planetary positions and renders one set of astrocartographic lines.

**Visual Design:**
- Should look like a **normal, single-user chart** — clean and simple, not doubled up
- Standard line weight and opacity (same as the solo map experience)

**Language & Tone:**
- All interpretations and card text should be phrased from the perspective of the relationship: *"Your composite chart suggests…"*, *"Together, your shared energy in this region…"*
- Emphasize long-term, shared-purpose language (building a life, partnership goals, collective growth)

---

### 📚 Educational Tooltips

Pop-up tooltips that explain the difference between the two modes when the user first encounters Bonds or taps an info icon:

- **Synastry tooltip:** *"Synastry shows how each of you individually feels in a place — think short-term comfort, personal energy, and day-to-day vibes."*
- **Composite tooltip:** *"The Composite chart merges both of your charts into one. It reveals your shared destiny — where you thrive as a unit over the long term."*

---

### 🚩 Red Flag Notifications (Areas of Interest)

Intelligent alerts that cross-reference the two views to surface important insights:

#### Red Flags
> [!CAUTION]
> If the **Composite view** looks great in a region but the **Synastry view** reveals that one partner has a very difficult line (Pluto or Saturn) running through that same area — trigger a **Red Flag** notification.

- Example: *"⚠️ Your composite chart loves Tokyo, but Partner B has a Pluto-DSC line here. This could mean intense personal transformation for them even though the relationship energy is strong."*
- These alerts help users avoid locations that look ideal on paper but may cause stress for one person individually.

#### Positive Synastry Overlaps
- Surface any regions where both partners share strongly **positive** line overlaps (Venus, Jupiter, Sun near each other)
- Example: *"✨ Both of you have benefic lines converging near Lisbon — this area is harmonious for each of you individually."*

#### Composite Insights
- For the Destiny view, keep insights straightforward — one merged chart, phrased in the collective:
- *"Your composite Sun-MC line runs through this region, suggesting it's a place where your partnership can achieve public recognition and career growth together."*

## Birth Time Unknown Mode

Many users don't know their exact birth time. Planet positions (signs) are mostly accurate without time — outer planets barely move in a day, even the Sun only shifts ~1°. The Moon (~13°/day) is the exception. However, **astrocartography lines shift dramatically** — MC/IC/ASC/DSC depend on Greenwich Sidereal Time at birth, which rotates ~360° over 24 hours.

**Plan:**
- Add a "I don't know my birth time" toggle during onboarding
- Default to noon (12:00) when time is unknown
- Show a persistent disclaimer banner on the Map: *"Lines are approximate — exact birth time improves accuracy"*
- Still allow full app usage (insights, city analysis, etc.) with the caveat
- Later: offer birth time rectification as a premium feature

## Cyclocartography — Time-Based Line Activation (Subscription Killer Feature)

Your natal planetary lines never change, but **transiting planets activate them at specific times**. This is called Cyclocartography — the "when" to astrocartography's "where." This feature would give users a reason to check the app daily/weekly and is the strongest case for a subscription model.

### How It Works (Astrology)

Cyclocartography combines two timing techniques:

| Technique | Planets Used | Speed | What It Shows |
|-----------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| **Transits** | Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto | Slow (months to years) | Long-term activation periods. When transiting Jupiter crosses your natal Venus line, that location becomes extra lucky for love/money for months. |
| **Secondary Progressions** | Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars | Very slow (Sun ~1°/year, Moon ~13°/year) | Deep, evolutionary shifts. Progressed Moon takes ~27 years to cycle — when it hits a natal line region, that's a significant life chapter. |

For inner planets (Sun through Mars), we use **progressions** because they transit so fast (Sun = 1°/day) that transit effects are too brief to be useful. For outer planets (Jupiter through Pluto), we use **actual transits** because they move slowly enough to create lasting activations.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Transit Calculator (Core Engine)
- **Calculate current transiting planet positions** — extend `calculatePlanetPositions()` to accept any date (not just birth date)
- **Calculate secondary progressions** — for a given birth date and current date, compute progressed positions (1 day of ephemeris = 1 year of life)
- **Transit-to-natal aspect detection** — find when transiting/progressed planets conjunct, square, trine, or oppose natal line positions
- **Activation windows** — compute date ranges when each natal line is "active" (within orb of transit aspect)

#### Phase 2: "Active Now" UI Layer
- **Insights tab: "Active Lines" section** — show which of the user's natal lines are currently being activated by transits
- **Badge on map lines** — pulse/glow effect on lines that are currently transited
- **Activation calendar** — month-by-month view showing which lines will be active when
- **"Best Time to Visit" per city** — for each city in insights, show the next upcoming activation window

#### Phase 3: Notifications & Subscription Hook
- **Push notifications** — "Your Venus ASC line is being activated by Jupiter this month — great time to visit [City]!"
- **Weekly digest** — "This week's cosmic weather for your map"
- **Monthly forecast** — which lines are strongest this month, travel recommendations
- **Gate behind Pro+ subscription** — free users see "You have 3 lines activating this month" teaser, paid users get full details + notifications

#### Phase 4: Visual Timeline
- **Timeline scrubber** — drag a slider to see how transiting lines move across the map over time (like Solar Fire's animation but mobile-friendly)
- **Year-at-a-glance** — calendar heatmap showing which months are best for which cities
- **Transit overlays on map** — show transiting planet lines alongside natal lines in a different style (dotted, different color family)

### Technical Complexity Estimate
- Phase 1: ~2 days (extend astronomy engine, add progression math) ✅ DONE
- Phase 2: ~3 days (UI components, integration with existing insights/map) ✅ DONE (core)
- Phase 3: ~2 days (push notification setup, subscription gating)
- Phase 4: ~3 days (timeline animation, calendar visualization)
- **Total: ~10 days** for full cyclocartography feature

### ✅ Implemented (Phase 1 + 2 Core)

**Transit Engine** (`lib/transits.ts`):
- `getTransitPositions()` — calculate any planet's position for any date
- `getProgressedPositions()` — secondary progressions (1 day = 1 year of life)
- `findTransitAspects()` — detect conjunction, opposition, trine, square, sextile between transit/progressed and natal positions
- `getCurrentActivations()` — get all currently active line activations with intensity + insights
- `findActivationWindows()` — scan date ranges to find activation periods
- `getCityActivation()` — per-city transit info including "best time to visit"
- `findImportantDates()` — surface significant dates without daily-horoscope overload (max ~3/month)

**TimeScrubber Component** (`components/TimeScrubber.tsx`):
- Horizontal month timeline with tap-to-select
- Quick jump buttons: Today, +1M, +3M, +6M, +1Y
- Month/year navigation with prev/next arrows
- Jump-to-date modal with year selector + month grid
- Compact mode for inline use (city detail)
- Activation intensity heatmap dots on months

**Insights Tab — Active Lines Section**:
- Shows all currently activated natal lines with transit/progression info
- Intensity badges (exact, strong, moderate, fading)
- Per-activation insights (what it means, what to do)
- "Applying" indicator when aspect is getting stronger
- Full TimeScrubber for time navigation

**City Detail — Cosmic Timing Section**:
- Overall activation strength badge (Peak, Active, Building, Quiet)
- Compact TimeScrubber for date navigation
- Per-city transit list showing which lines are activated
- "Best Time to Visit" card with date range + description (tiered labels per transit type)
- "Next Activation" fallback when no current transits

#### Phase 2 Refinements (Completed)

- **Transit synthesis:** When & Where — best/intense places to visit in 1 month, 3 months, or 1 year (Insights > Transits tab)
- **Tiered timing verbiage:** Replace generic "Best Time to Visit" with transit-specific labels — benefic (Jupiter/Venus) vs evolutionary (Saturn/Pluto/Uranus/Mars)
- **City detail UI:** Synthesis paragraph ("Your story here") moved to top of hero; Living/Visiting blurbs below
- **Line cards:** bestFor and challenges rendered as horizontal chips (like themes)
- **Map zoom–dependent city density:** Hotspots and transit glows show more cities when zoomed in, fewer when zoomed out

**Timing copy (canonical tiered phrasing):**

| Transit type | App phrasing |
|--------------|--------------|
| Jupiter/Venus (trine/conjunct) | "Optimal Window for Flow", "Abundance Peak" |
| Saturn | "Growth through Discipline", "Structure Phase" |
| Pluto | "Deep Transformation", "Personal Alchemy" |
| Uranus | "Unpredictable Breakthroughs", "Sudden Pivot" |
| Mars | "Action Phase", "High Energy" |

### Why This Is the Subscription Killer Feature
1. **Daily/weekly engagement** — "What's active on my map right now?" gives users a reason to open the app constantly
2. **Time-sensitive notifications** — creates urgency and FOMO ("Jupiter is crossing your Venus line THIS MONTH")
3. **Travel planning utility** — "When is the best time to visit Paris?" is incredibly actionable
4. **Always changing** — unlike static natal lines, transits ensure fresh content every time the user opens the app
5. **Natural paywall** — free users see that lines are activating but need to subscribe for details

---

## Notifications & Important Dates (Phase 3 — Next Up)

The transit engine already computes `findImportantDates()` — the remaining work is connecting it to push notifications and building the notification preferences UI.

### Smart Notification System

Unlike daily horoscopes that become noise, Stellaris notifications are **rare, specific, and actionable**:

| Notification Type | Frequency | Example |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| **Major transit alert** | 2-4x/year | "Jupiter is crossing your Venus line this month — Lisbon enters a lucky window for love and money" |
| **Best time to travel** | Monthly digest | "March's best cities for you: Tokyo (Venus activation), Barcelona (Jupiter trine)" |
| **Activation starting** | When a new window opens | "Your Sun lines just lit up — career energy peaks in New York through April" |
| **Important date reminder** | 1-2 days before exact aspect | "Tomorrow: Saturn conjuncts your Moon. Emotional resilience matters in these cities." |

### Design Principles for Notifications
- **Max 2-3 per month** — the `findImportantDates()` function already enforces this limit
- **Always tied to a location** — "Jupiter crossing your Venus line" → "…and here's where that matters: Lisbon, Porto, Marrakech"
- **Actionable** — every notification should tell you what to *do* (visit, plan, be aware, avoid)
- **Not a daily horoscope** — if someone gets a notification every day, the system has failed

### Vacation & Travel Planning Mode (Future)
- "When should I visit [City]?" — shows the next 12 months of activation windows ranked by positivity
- "Where should I travel in [Month]?" — reverse lookup: given a date, which cities have the best transits
- Shareable travel recommendations: "The stars say you should visit Bali in September — here's why"

### Important Dates Calendar View (Future)
- Year-at-a-glance heatmap showing activation intensity per month
- Tap a month to see which cities are "lit up" and why
- Categories: Travel, Career, Love, Growth, Caution
- Export to device calendar

---

## Future / Not planned (consumer app scope)

- **Geodetics:** Full geodetic map overlays are not in scope for the consumer product; the app focuses on standard ACG lines and synthesis.
- **Advanced timing:** Zodiacal Releasing, Primary Directions, and similar techniques are out of scope; we stick to **transits + progressions** (CCG) for "when" and high-impact alerts.
- **Aspect lines on map:** Primary map remains **conjunction-only** (planet on angle). Aspect lines (e.g. trine/square lines) are a possible **next-phase** feature (major aspects only, synthesis-first); see Relocated Chart & Synthesis plan.

---

## Future Considerations

- **Multiple bonds:** Allow viewing Bonds with different friends (one at a time)
- **Saved locations:** Let couples bookmark locations and add notes
- **Travel planning mode:** Compare Synastry + Composite for a shortlist of cities
- **Temporal layers:** Add transit overlays on top of Bonds charts for "best time to visit" features
- **AI city recommendations:** "Tell me what you're looking for" → personalized city suggestions
- **Relocation reports:** Downloadable PDF with full analysis of a city ($4.99 add-on)
- **Birth time rectification:** Use life events to estimate birth time (premium feature)
